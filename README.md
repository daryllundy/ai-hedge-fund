poetry install
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks for security checks:
```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

4. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by Groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

### Using Docker
1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit the .env file to add your API keys as described above.

5. Navigate to the docker directory:
```bash
cd docker
```

6. Build the Docker image:

```

**Important**: You must set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for the hedge fund to work. If you want to use LLMs from all providers, set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.
